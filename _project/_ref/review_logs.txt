  alt: 'a conceptual illustration about perception and truth. It depicts a cylindrical object in the center, labeled "THIS IS TRUTH" with an arrow pointing to it. On the left side, the cylinder casts a rectangular shadow labeled "THIS IS TRUE" with an arrow. On the right side, the same cylinder casts a circular shadow, also labeled "THIS IS TRUE" with an arrow. The illustration demonstrates how the same object (truth) can appear differently depending on perspective, yet both perspectives are valid representations of the underlying reality.',
